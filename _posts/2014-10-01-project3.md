This week, we learned about 3D printing. The requirement for the project was to design and print something that could not be made easily without 3D printing. I decided to make a Rubiks Cube, since it has a bunch of interlocking parts and could theoretically be printed fully assembled.

I started by understanding how a Rubiks Cube works and CAD-ing my own in Solidworks. Below are snapshots of the four components of the cube: the corner pieces, the edge pieces, the center pieces, and the yoke.

Yoke - This is the component in the inside of the cube that holds the four sides together

Center Piece - These attach to the yoke

Edge Piece - These interlock with the center pieces

Corner Piece - These interlock with the edge pieces

Next, I created an assembly in SolidWorks, using a 0.015 inch gap between the parts of the cube so that it could be printed on the Dimension 3D printer, and exported the assembly as a .stl mesh.

Tom printed the cube and then put it in a bash to dissolve the supports. Finally, I had a 3D printed cube :)

Some things I learned from this week are:

1. To build in more spacing that 0.15 inches between the pieces to ensure that they move
2. To pay more attention to how the mates I make in SolidWorks export to the mesh. There was an issue with how the center pieces and the yoke mate together, making it impossible to fully rotate the cube.

... In otherwords, its a perfectly solved Rubiks Cube and cannot be unsolved.

I also 3D scanned a LEGO to understand more about how 3D scanning works with the SENSE scanner. I had issues with keeping a steady hand and the correct distance away from the object, but ended up getting a somewhat LEGO-like object.
